# 🏡 House Price Prediction

Predicting house prices using *Linear Regression* based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## 📊 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a simple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on basic property features. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

### Features Used:
- 📏 Square Footage
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
- 🛁 Number of Bathrooms

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- notebook/: Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.
- src/: Python scripts that contain the core logic for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries and dependencies to run the project.
